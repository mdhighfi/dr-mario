What is the purpose of pillIsLanded?
How often is it called?

currentPill pos? is that on the small grid or on the big grid of pixels?

Should I be keeping track of grid pos as an attribute or just calculating it every time?

Optimization: only check for stopping if it reaches a grid position

if changeInGridPos
if landed()
check pillLandedOn(object) for each object
